# interpreter-project
Creating an interpreter for my CISC 3160 Project

Required external library:
mariuszgromada.math.MathParser.mXparser

The project reads from an input file a set of assignment statements, tests each line if all assignments are valid using a regex interpreter
The assignment method tests individual assignments and returns true or false to the interpreter
Methods term, exp, and fact use recursive method calls for recursion.
Project implements variable assignment to parser package and prints out each variable's assignment if assignments passed the interpreter's tests.
